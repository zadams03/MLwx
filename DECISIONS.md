## 2026-08-16 — Initial decisions from planning

**D1. The project is bias-correction, not weather prediction from scratch.**
We are not building a weather model. GFS already does the physics well. We
learn and correct its repeated *local* mistakes at one airport. Reason:
building a weather model from scratch is a solved, resource-heavy problem we
could only do worse; correcting local bias is tractable, useful, and runs on
a laptop.

**D2. Location: London City airport (EGLC).** Reason: airports report clean,
official, standardised hourly observations, which is the "what actually
happened" truth the method needs.

**D3. Truth data from IEM, not Weather Underground.** Reason: the free
Weather Underground API was discontinued at the end of 2018, and what remains
is largely *personal* weather stations (back-garden sensors) of inconsistent
quality and siting. Those are the wrong ground truth — a forecast should be
checked against an official station, not a hobbyist sensor. IEM serves
official airport METARs free, no account. EGLC confirmed live on IEM (a
current observation was returned dated 10 August 2026).

**D4. Forecast data from Open-Meteo Previous Runs API — NOT the Historical
Forecast API.** This is a critical, easy-to-get-wrong choice.
- The **Previous Runs API** gives genuine past forecasts at a fixed lead-time
  offset (e.g. the value predicted exactly 24 hours before). This is what we
  want: it is what a real forecast looked like on the day.
- The **Historical Forecast API**, despite the name, stitches the freshest
  few hours of many runs into one series — which effectively already contains
  the answer. Training on it would be look-ahead leakage.
Open-Meteo's own docs describe the Previous Runs API as the correct dataset
for training bias-correction models without look-ahead bias.

**D5. Data floor is March 2021.** Confirmed: Open-Meteo's archive of past GFS
forecasts (2m temperature) goes back to March 2021 — about 4.5 years. Reason
it can't go earlier: genuine point-resolution past forecasts were not
routinely archived before then, so that history mostly does not exist to be
recovered. This is a real floor, not a paywall. 4.5 years is enough for
stage 1 (covers several full seasonal cycles).

**D6. Reanalysis (e.g. ERA5, back to 1940) is NOT used as the forecast to
correct.** Reanalysis is a reconstruction of the past made *with* the
observations fed in — it is not a real forecast and has little forecast error
to learn from. Using it would quietly turn the project into a weaker,
different exercise. (It could legitimately help only for computing a
climatology baseline, but for stage 1 we compute climatology from the IEM
observations we already have, so ERA5 is not needed at all.)

**D7. Training window: train ~March 2021 to mid-2025; hold out the most
recent ~12 months as an untouched test period.** Reason: a full-year test set
judges the result across all four seasons, so a lucky run of easy weather
cannot flatter it.

**D8. Stage 1 lead time: 24 hours only. 48 hours is a planned later
addition.** Reason: stage 1's job is to prove the pipeline works end to end;
one lead time keeps it simplest and most reviewable. Comparing 24h vs 48h
(how bias grows with lead time) is interesting but comes later.

**D9. Stage 1 target: temperature at one fixed hour of the day.** This
evolved during planning. The owner ultimately wants a live tool showing a
corrected temperature *curve* across the day (e.g. the 9am value, the noon
value, the daily max). But we deliberately keep stage 1 to a single fixed
hour — the cleanest possible test of "does the core idea work?" — so that a
weak result points clearly at the idea, not at added complexity. Widening to
the full hourly curve is stage 5; the daily max then falls out as the peak of
the curve.

**D10. Evaluation bar (frozen): beat raw GFS AND persistence on MAE over the
held-out test period.** Beating raw GFS is the core claim; beating persistence
("tomorrow = today") is the honesty check against the laziest guess.
Climatology (seasonal average) is an optional third check. The numeric margin
is left qualitative for now; a specific figure may be fixed just before
running, but still before seeing results, and logged here at that point.

**D11. Missing data: drop, count, report — never fill.** Reason: filled data
is invented data and muddies the honest measurement. If gaps turn out
frequent enough to matter, that is a finding to log here, not something to
auto-patch.

**D12. Model type: gradient-boosted trees.** Reason: the data is
table-shaped (one row per forecast, a handful of numeric features), which is
exactly what tree models handle well, and they run on a laptop CPU with no
GPU needed.

## 2026-08-16 — Parked items (revisit from inside the work, do not act yet)

**P1. Overall project direction (deeper / wider / sideways).** No specific
pull yet. Decide after a couple of locations are working, from inside the
work rather than up front.

**P2. The WeatherNext angle.** Google DeepMind open-sourced WeatherNext 2 (an
AI-native weather model) in 2026. It fits our plan at stage 4 in three ways:
(a) swap it in as the base forecast and correct it the same way we correct
GFS — the open, likely-unpublished question is whether a fresh AI model
carries a learnable local bias like GFS does; (b) blend it with GFS — it is a
promising blend partner because it is built on completely different
principles, so its mistakes may not overlap with GFS's; (c) later, correct
its ensemble spread (a "go deeper" move). All parked until stage 1 passes.
Two things to verify before betting on it: whether its *past* forecasts can be
pulled in bulk (the method needs history), and whether anyone has already
done this local evaluation (probably not, but check before claiming novelty).

**P3. Harder evaluation bars.** Beating operational post-processed forecasts
(a much higher bar than raw GFS), and demanding statistical significance /
multi-season robustness. Known as the honest "ceiling" but the wrong weight
for stage 1. Revisit once stage 1 passes.

## 2026-08-16 — Open questions (verify on contact)

**Q1. Does the Previous Runs API actually return history back to 2021 on the
first real pull** (not just recent months)? Current docs say yes; confirm on
contact.

**Q2. Is EGLC's observation record complete enough** over the chosen period?
Confirm on the first pull; apply the drop-count-report rule (D11) to whatever
gaps appear.

---

## 2026-08-16 — Session 01 findings (first real data pull)

Both sources were pulled for real. Q1 and Q2 above are now answered and
closed. Nothing was filled, cleaned, or joined.

**F1. Q1 answered — yes, the forecast archive reaches March 2021, but it
starts on 24 March 2021, not 1 March.** A request for 1–7 March 2021 came
back HTTP 200 with all 168 hourly values null. Stepping the date forward
found the first hour with a real value: **2021-03-24 00:00 UTC**. Spot checks
at 15 April 2021, 1 May, 15 May, 15 June, 15 September, 15 December 2021,
15 March 2022, 15 March 2023 and 15 March 2025 all came back complete, so the
archive is continuous from that start. This refines D5 rather than
contradicting it: the floor is real, and about 5 years 5 months of history is
available up to today. SPEC 3.2 and 4.3 say "March 2021", which is still
true; the owner may want to write the exact date in.

**F2. Q2 answered — EGLC's observation record is good.** Counting a whole
hour as covered only if it has a routine report carrying a real temperature:
- Recent sample, 1–21 July 2026: 504 hours expected, **504 covered, 0 gaps**.
- Early sample, 18 March – 1 April 2021: 336 hours expected, **333 covered,
  3 gaps (0.89%)**. The missing hours are 2021-03-20 06:00, 2021-03-30 05:00
  and 2021-03-30 06:00 UTC.
All three gaps are whole reports that were never filed, not rows with a blank
temperature. They sit in the early-morning hours, and two of the three are
next to each other, which looks like a short outage rather than a pattern.
Nothing was filled (SPEC 2.2). On this evidence the gap rate is low enough
that dropping unpaired rows will cost very little data, but that is a
two-week snapshot, not proof about the whole period.

**F3. EGLC reports twice an hour, not once.** IEM splits its reports into
"routine" (report_type=3) and "special" (report_type=4). Normally "special"
means an unscheduled extra report. At EGLC it is not: over 1–21 July 2026
there were exactly 504 reports at :50 and exactly 504 at :20 — one of each
per hour, none missing. So EGLC files a scheduled half-hourly report. This
session used the routine :50 report as the hourly observation and kept the
combined pull as a second raw file for the record. The extra :20 report is
spare data available later if it is ever useful.

**F4. The 24-hour-ahead forecast variable is
`temperature_2m_previous_day1`.** This is the value from the model run one
day earlier, which is what SPEC 3.2 asks for. The endpoint also offers a
plain `temperature_2m`, which on this API is the freshest-run series — the
leakage trap SPEC 2.1b warns about. It was deliberately not requested, so it
is not in any raw file. The model name used was `gfs_seamless`.

---

## 2026-08-16 — Open questions raised by session 01 (not acted on)

These came up during session 01 and are outside its scope. Logged for the
owner, per CLAUDE.md.

**Q3. How should an observation timed at :50 be lined up with a forecast
valid on the hour?** The forecast series is stamped on the hour (12:00). The
observation is stamped at :50 (11:50 or 12:50). They are 10 minutes apart
either way, so something has to be chosen and written down before the join.
The obvious candidates are "use the :50 report from the same hour" or "use
the nearest report". This needs deciding before any pairing happens.

**Q4. What exactly does "previous_day1" mean in lead-time hours?** It is the
run from one day earlier, but whether every hour of the day is a clean
24 hours ahead, or whether the lead time drifts across the day depending on
which run cycle is used, was not verified in this session. It matters because
SPEC 3.2 and D8 fix stage 1 at a 24-hour lead time. Worth confirming against
Open-Meteo's documentation before training.

**Q5. The model grid point is about 4 km from the airport.** EGLC is at lat
51.505, lon 0.055. The API returned the nearest GFS cell at lat 51.487137,
lon 0.0, elevation 4 m — about 4.3 km away. The station's own record puts it
at lat 51.5053, lon 0.0553, elevation 5 m. The elevations nearly match, so
there is no height mismatch to worry about, and a fixed distance offset is
exactly the kind of steady local error this project is built to learn. Noted
so it is a known fact rather than a surprise later.

**Q6. Should raw data files go into version control?** The repo has no
`.gitignore`. The session 01 pulls are small (126 KB in total), so
committing them is easy and makes the snapshot rule (SPEC 2.3) very concrete.
A full multi-year pull will be much bigger. The owner decides at commit time;
nothing was committed or ignored this session. There is also an untracked
`.DS_Store` file that macOS created.

---

## 2026-08-16 — Session 02 decisions (owner's choices, now locked)

**D13. The train/test split is now a fixed pair of dates.**
- **Training period: 2021-03-24 to 2025-07-31** (inclusive).
- **Test period: 2025-08-01 to 2026-07-31** (inclusive) — held out and
  untouched until the final evaluation. That is a clean 12 months, so the
  result is judged across all four seasons.
- Data after 2025-07-31 that falls outside the test period — that is, anything
  from 2026-08-01 to today — is simply not used. This keeps the test set
  exactly one calendar year.
- Reason it is fixed now: the evaluation bar must be frozen before any model
  runs (SPEC 2.4), and the split date is part of that bar. Fixing it now means
  it cannot be chosen later to flatter the result.

**D14. Observation-to-forecast pairing rule (answers Q3).**
- The routine `:50` report is the hourly truth observation (per F3).
- Each forecast valid at `HH:00` is paired with the observation nearest that
  hour — in practice the `:50` report ten minutes before it.
- If no report exists within 15 minutes of the hour, that hour is dropped and
  counted (SPEC 2.2). Nothing is filled in.
- Reason: ten minutes is a negligible gap for temperature, so this adds no
  meaningful error, and a single written rule stops the pairing being decided
  ad hoc later.

**D15. Raw data is committed to version control (answers Q6).**
- Raw pulls are small for one station and one variable, so they go into the
  repository. That makes the immutable-snapshot rule (SPEC 2.3) concrete and
  the project reproducible from the history alone.
- If the data volume ever grows a lot — many stations, many variables — this
  is revisited.
- A `.gitignore` was added for operating-system and Python clutter. It
  deliberately does **not** ignore `data/raw/`.

## 2026-08-16 — Session 02 findings (documentation checks)

Both checks below were done against Open-Meteo's own documentation. F6 also
used a small throwaway request to the live API to test which model names are
accepted; nothing from it was saved to `data/raw/`, and the exact query is
written out below so it can be repeated.

**F5. Q4 answered — `previous_day1` is a *nominal* 24-hour lead, not an exact
one. The real lead runs from about 24 hours up to about 30 hours, and it
cycles through the day.** This matters, so here is the evidence in order.

The Previous Runs API documentation page states the simple version:

> "`_previous_day0` is the current model run (equivalent to the live Forecast
> API). `_previous_day1` is the value that was predicted 24 hours before valid
> time, `_previous_day2` 48 hours before, and so on up to day 7."

and

> "Data from past model runs is aligned to fixed lead-time offsets of 1–7
> days."

But Open-Meteo's own article on the feature explains how the series is
actually built, and it is not one run from 24 hours ago:

> "For **Previous Day 1**, with a forecast lead-time offset of 24 hours, it
> doesn't entail retrieving a single weather model run from 24 hours ago.
> Instead, the initial 24 hours of each weather model run are disregarded. In
> models updating every 3 hours, time steps 24, 25, and 26 are utilized to
> form a continuous time-series."

So each run contributes only the hours it is needed for, starting at its own
hour 24. GFS updates every 6 hours (00Z, 06Z, 12Z, 18Z), so by the same rule
each GFS run contributes its time steps 24 to 29 — meaning the effective lead
time sweeps from 24 hours up to 29 hours and then resets, six hours at a time,
right through the day. Open-Meteo's documentation gives this worked example
for a 3-hourly model only; the 6-hourly case is the same rule applied to GFS,
not a separately published number.

The maintainer confirms the same picture on the project's discussion board,
and adds the processing delay:

> "a 24 hour lead-time is in reality 24 hours + 5:20 for processing"

and describes the stitching directly — for a model of that update cadence,
"hours 0-6 from the 00Z run, hours 6-12 from the 06Z run, and so forth".

**Does this match SPEC's "24-hour lead" framing (SPEC 3.2, D8)?** Mostly, but
not exactly. It matches in the way that matters: every value is a genuine
forecast made at least 24 hours before the hour it describes, so there is no
look-ahead leakage (SPEC 2.1b holds). It does not match the literal reading
that every hour is a clean 24 hours ahead. The honest description is "a
day-ahead forecast at a 24-to-30-hour lead", and this is exactly the dataset
Open-Meteo recommends for training bias-correction models. Whether to reword
SPEC is left to the owner — see Q7.

**F6. C2 answered — at EGLC, `gfs_seamless` is purely NCEP GFS, and it returns
data identical to the explicit `gfs_global` string.**

What "seamless" means: Open-Meteo's documentation says a seamless model
"combines all models from a given provider into a seamless prediction", and
for each location picks the highest-resolution model that covers it. For the
NCEP provider the candidates are GFS (global) and HRRR/NAM/NBM (all
CONUS-only, that is the United States). HRRR "data are only available for the
United States, while for other locations, only GFS is used". EGLC is in
London, so no CONUS model can ever apply, and nothing non-GFS is in the NCEP
set to mix in.

That was then checked against the live API. The same request was sent with
several model names, for EGLC, 1–2 July 2026:

```
https://previous-runs-api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
  ?latitude=51.505&longitude=0.055
  &hourly=temperature_2m_previous_day1
  &models=<NAME>
  &start_date=2026-07-01&end_date=2026-07-02&timezone=UTC
```

Results:

| model name            | result                                                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `gfs_seamless`        | OK — 48 hours, 0 missing, grid 51.487137 / 0.0, elev 4 m  |
| `gfs_global`          | OK — 48 hours, 0 missing, same grid point                 |
| `ncep_gfs_seamless`   | OK — 48 hours, 0 missing, same grid point                 |
| `ncep_gfs_global`     | OK — 48 hours, 0 missing, same grid point                 |
| `gfs013`              | OK — 48 hours, 0 missing, same grid point                 |
| `gfs025`              | accepted, but all 48 values null (grid 51.5 / 0.0)        |
| `gfs_graphcast025`    | accepted, but all 48 values null                          |
| `gfs_global_011`      | rejected — "invalid String value gfs_global_011"          |
| `gfs_global_025`      | rejected — "invalid String value gfs_global_025"          |
| `ncep_gfs_global_011` | rejected — "invalid String value ncep_gfs_global_011"     |
| `ncep_gfs_global_025` | rejected — "invalid String value ncep_gfs_global_025"     |
| `gfs_hrrr`            | rejected — HTTP 400                                       |

Note that the names shown on the current documentation page (`ncep_gfs_global_011`,
`ncep_gfs_global_025`) are **not** accepted by this endpoint. The names that
work are the shorter ones.

`gfs_seamless` and `gfs_global` were then compared value by value over two
windows:
- 1–21 July 2026: 504 hours, **identical, 0 differing values**, 0 missing in
  either.
- 24 March – 5 April 2021 (the very start of the archive): 312 hours,
  **identical, 0 differing values**, 0 missing in either.

Also worth recording: `gfs_graphcast025` returns nothing for this variable and
period, so Google/DeepMind-style AI output is not quietly entering the series
even in principle.

**Recommendation (for the owner to confirm — nothing was changed).** Pin the
explicit string **`gfs_global`** for the session 3 pull, instead of
`gfs_seamless`. At EGLC the two are provably the same data, so this costs
nothing, but it makes the claim "this is exactly NCEP GFS" true by
construction rather than by argument, and it stops a future change to
Open-Meteo's seamless blending from silently changing the dataset underneath
us. If the owner prefers to keep `gfs_seamless` for consistency with the
session 01 raw files, that is also defensible on this evidence — but the
choice should be written down either way. See Q8. Note for stage 2: CDG is
also in Europe, so the same reasoning applies there, but it should be
re-checked rather than assumed.

**Q5 closed — accepted.** The roughly 4 km gap between the airport and the GFS
grid point (returned again as lat 51.487137, lon 0.0, elevation 4 m in every
successful probe above) is accepted as-is. A steady distance offset is exactly
the kind of repeated local error this project exists to learn, and the
elevations nearly match, so there is no height problem. No action needed.

---

## 2026-08-16 — Open questions raised by session 02 (not acted on)

**Q7. Should SPEC's "24-hour lead" wording be made more precise?** F5 shows
the real lead is 24 to about 30 hours, sweeping through the day. SPEC 3.2 says
"a fixed lead-time offset of 1 day (24 hours ahead)" and D8 says "24 hours
only". Neither is wrong in spirit and neither creates leakage, but a reader
could take them literally. Session 02's authorised SPEC edits did not cover
this, so nothing was changed. The owner decides whether to reword SPEC 3.2,
and whether the varying lead should later become a feature the model can see.

**Q8. Which model string does session 3 pull with — `gfs_global` or
`gfs_seamless`?** F6 recommends `gfs_global` and shows the two are identical
at EGLC today. This needs the owner's word before the full historical pull,
because it is baked into every raw file after that.

**Q9. `.DS_Store` is already tracked, so the new `.gitignore` rule cannot
take effect on it.** Q6 recorded `.DS_Store` as untracked, but it went into
the session 01 commit. The `.gitignore` added this session does match it
(`git check-ignore --no-index` confirms the rule fires), but git ignores
ignore-rules for files it is already tracking, so the file stays in the
history until someone runs `git rm --cached .DS_Store`. That is a version-
control action, which Claude Code never takes (CLAUDE.md), and it is outside
this session's scope. Left for the owner.
